    <!-- add image of mouth
     have mouth close on click
     repeat this action of opening and closing per click
     state 1 is one image
     state 2 is the other,
     once reaching state 2 and clicked again, reset to state 1
     have a tally of total times clicked in addition to the states resetting
     "you have eaten __ berries"
    when reaching 20- or more clicks, have text appear that says "wow you're hungry"

     <!-- new idea

     title : find the homer
      have a bunch of drawings of homers on  a site 
      tile them, maybe duplicate them, and have them flex with the site
      have the images centered, like a grid of 20x20 homers, or more
      have one special homer that can be clicked on
      when clicked on, change the image from homerstate1 to homerstate2
      homerstate2 is smiling cheekily
      have text say "you caught the homer"
      optional & difficult addition: have a button that says "play again?" appear after the homer is caught
      play again would reshuffle all the images in the grid, place the  special homer somewhere else, and restart the cycle
      

      have a sound bite play something like. or or or or. fnaf freddy sound
